    <div class="faq__questions">
        <p>Last updated August 21, 2023.</p>
        <p>Bonjour is a mobile app to help you make friends in new areas. Users say something and upload an audio bio, message new people or receive messages from people and show their approximate location to help create a more real experience. Your location can be turned off anytime very easily and does not track you live. Because Bonjour is designed for college students, we care deeply about safety and user privacy. We try to limit the data we collect to what is necessary to use the app and connect with new people.
            Below, we outline what data we collect, how we use and share it, and your rights.
            </p>
        <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
        <h2>Account Data</h2>
        <p>When you sign up for an account on Bonjour, you are asked to enter your phone number, name, gender, age, voice bio and up to three profile photos. This data is used to help new people understand who you are, and to make it easier for your previous friends to find your account on the service. </p>              
        <h2>Contacts Data</h2>
        <p>When signing up for an account on Bonjour, you have the option to give Bonjour access to your address book to find friends on Bonjour. We will use your Contacts in order to identify other Users that you may know or that your Contacts may know and to provide you and other Users with suggestions with whom to connect, such as friends-of-friends.. We will never send text messages to your Contacts without your explicit permission.
            You can invite friends to join Bonjour by sending them a text message with a link to install the app. The invitation may include the names of your friends on Bonjour. We do not automatically send messages to your friends on your behalf. Instead, you have to send the message yourself. This means you're always in control of what messages get sent to your friends. 
            </p>
        <h2>Location Data</h2>
        <p>While creating an account on Bonjour, you have the option to give Bonjour access to your approximate location data. Without location on, you will not be able to send or receive messages from anyone on the app. The idea is seeing location online creates a more real experience. We will use your approximate location to suggest nearby friends. Once the app is closed, your location is not tracked. Only while using the app is your location tracked. You can turn off or on your location anytime. </p>
        <h2>Device and App Activity Data
        </h2>
        <p>When you use the app, we automatically collect certain information about your device (such as the type of device, operating system, IP address, and unique identifiers) and how you interact with the app (such as the actions you take and how long you use the app). We use this information to improve the app, create new features, and keep our systems secure.</p>
        <h2>How We Disclose Data</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, license, or lease your data to third parties, nor do we share it with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising. However, we may disclose it to the following third parties:</p1>
            
        <p>Service Providers – such as hosting services, customer support services, and analytics services.</p>
        <p>Professional Advisors – such as lawyers and accountants.</p>
        <p>Business Transaction Recipients – including counterparties and others assisting with a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, dissolution, asset sale, or similar transaction involving our business.</p>  
        <p>Legal and Safety – government authorities or regulators or other third parties where required by law or legal process or to protect Bonjour, users’, or other third parties’ rights and safety.</p>
        <h2>How You Share Data
        </h2>
        <p>You can use Bonjour to make friends. After creating an account on Bonjour and once your location is on, others may see your mutual friends and listen to your audio bio. If you message someone, they will be able to hear your messages.</p>
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We keep your data until we don’t need it for the purposes described in this policy and we have no legal obligation to keep it.</p>
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>We provide all users with the following rights:</p>
        <p>Deactivate – you can deactivate your account so that you will not be able to send or receive new messages and will not be listed on the map anymore;</p>
        <p>Access – you can download the data we have about you, where it is required by law;</p>
        <p>Delete – you can request that we delete the data we have about you, but this right is not absolute. We may need to keep certain information, for example, to comply with our legal requirements;</p>
        <p>Correct – you can ask that we fix any errors or inaccuracies in the data we hold about you;</p>
        <p>Stop processing – you can tell us to stop processing your data;</p>
        <p>Object – you can object to how we process your data;</p>
        <p>Complain – you can complain to the data protection regulator where you live (if you have one).</p>
        <p>You can exercise these rights by tapping Help on our website bonjourland.com, texting us at (682) 552-9882, or emailing us at help@bonjourland.com and providing the username and phone number associated with your account in your message. We will not treat you differently if you exercise any of these rights, but we may need additional information to verify your identity. An agent can also make these requests on your behalf, but we may still ask you to verify your identity and that you have authorized the agent to act on your behalf. Depending on your location, you may have the right to appeal our decision regarding a request related to the above rights, in which case, you may do so by contacting us using the above contact information.
            Your browser settings may allow you to transmit a “do not track” signal, “opt-out preference” signal, or other mechanism for exercising your choice regarding the collection of your data when you visit various websites and online services.  Our website and app are not designed to respond to such signals, and we do not use or disclose your data in any way that would legally require us to recognize opt-out preference signals.
            </p>
        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>People under 17 are prohibited from using Bonjour. We do not seek or knowingly collect any data from people under 17. If we learn that we have collected data from people under 17 without proper consent, we will delete that data. If you believe we have collected data from a user under 17, or if you are a parent or guardian of a user under 17 who has provided us data, please email us at help@bonjourland.com with information about the account to request that it be deleted.</p>
        <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
        <p>We may need to update this policy to account for changes in our business and applicable laws. If we change this policy, we will post the new version here. If the changes are significant we will notify you through the app.</p>
